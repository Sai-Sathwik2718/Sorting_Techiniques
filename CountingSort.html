        <h2>***Performs Sorting using Counting Sort Algorithm.***</h2>
    </div>
        <p>This sorting technique doesn't perform sorting by comparing elements. It performs sorting by 
            counting objects having distinct key values like hashing. After that, it performs some 
            arithmetic operations to calculate each object's index position in the output sequence. 
            Counting sort is not used as a general-purpose sorting algorithm.
            Counting sort is effective when range is not greater than number of objects to be sorted. It can 
            be used to sort the negative input values.
            </p>
        
        <p>Now let us evaluate this technique by taking a list of elements which sorts step wise.</p>
